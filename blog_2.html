		<h2>What is that?</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
				During my study at ITB I took the Dynamical System course twice. The first was at my bachelor (as <strong>Introduction to Dynamical System</strong>) 
				and the second during my master (as <strong>Dynamical System</strong>). Regardless of the name, the first course actually offered more depth and rigorousness compared to the latter. 
				Despite that, their syllabus are very similar and they have one thing in common: the mention of Numerical Continuation on the Bifurcation chapter. 
				My biggest regret is that I did not really pay attention to it while I took the course for the first time because I thought it's just a mere method to find bifurcation 
				parameter.
				<h4><center>Wait hold on.. what the heck is continuation?? and Bifurcation??</center></h4>
			</p>

			<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
				Well thanks for asking (no one did)... Now I feel obliged to explain them to you, in my own words. 
				<figure style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="images/bifurcation_animation.gif" atl="" style="width:40%;">
					<figcaption>Bifurcation in action.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</p>

		<h2>Bifurcation</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
				Bifurcation in general means <i>the point or area at which something divides into two branches or parts</i>. In mathematics lore, Bifurcation Theory is the mathematical 
				study of changes in the qualitative or topological structure of a given family of curves, such as the integral curves of a family of vector fields, and the solutions 
				of a family of differential equations.
				<br>
				<br>
				In short, 
				<i>
					<center style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
						Bifurcation occurs when a small change in certain parameters corresponding to a curve causes a sudden qualitative/form behavior to that curve
					</center>
				</i>
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
				Now, consider a nonlinear differential equation below:
				$$
				\dot{x} = x^2-\mu
				$$
				
				We will refer to the parameter \(\mu\) as <strong>bifurcation parameters</strong>.
				The equilibrium point for the differential equation above will be set of all solution \(x\) such that \(\dot{x}=0\).
				<br>
				For \(\mu=0\), the set of equilibrium point will be \(\{0\}\). If \(\mu=1\), there are no equilibrium point (thus the set of equilibria is \(\{\}\)) and when \(\mu=-1\) 
				it will be \(\{-1, 1\}\). Notice that as the value of \(\mu\) varies, the number of equlibrium points also change. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>The bifurcation diagram </strong> the graph showing all the observed
				values (in this case it's the equilibrium points, but it also could be periodic orbits or chaotic attractors) as a function of the bifurcation parameter. 
				Hence, the bifurcation diagram sketch for the problem above may be shown as:
				<figure style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="images/bif_sketch.png" atl="" style="width:35%;">
					<figcaption>
						Bifurcation diagram sketch. We have 0 equilibrium point if \(\mu<0\),
						one equilibria appears if \(\mu=0\) and there are two if \(\mu>0\).
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
				We can observe that the "branching" phenomenon occured at \(\mu=0\), and we call it the bifurcation point. As mentioned above, there are also commonly observable values
				other than fixed points such as: chaotic attractors, periodic orbits occurrence, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
		<h3>So what's the big deal?</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
			Well, the thing is, plotting a bifurcation diagram is super difficult for several reason. Conventional root finding algorithm will struggle on finding
			all roots from a single equation. Finding <i>all</i> solutions will be computationally expensive and difficult.
			The algorithm will perform smoothly until it hits a bifurcation point, and they will get "confused" as there are two paths to follow now instead of one (or no path at all).

		<h2>Solution: Pseudo Arc-length Continuation</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 100%;color: black;">
			Instead of having the bifurcation parameters grows slowly and have the root finding algorithm to find a solution, we can instead walking along the path to 
			form the bifurcation diagram. In other words, instead of having the equation parametrized by the bifurcation parameter it will be parametrized by the curve's arc length.
			The continuation algorithm can be implemented as follow:
			<br>
			Consider a function \(\textbf{F} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\) with fixed point \(\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n\) and bifurcation parameter \(\mu \in \mathbb{R}\). Assume
			\(\textbf{x}\) and \(\mu\) to both be parametrized by the arc-length \(s\). 
			Thus we have \(\textbf{F}(\textbf{x}(s);\mu(s))=0\) for all \(s\).
